For example, the CSS language definition\n       * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded\n       * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the\n       * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do\n       * this:\n       *\n       * ```js\n       * Prism.languages.markup.style = {\n       *     // token\n       * };\n       * ```\n       *\n       * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens\n       * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:\n       *\n       * ```js\n       * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'cdata', {\n       *     'style': {\n       *         // token\n       *     }\n       * });\n       * ```\n       *\n       * ## Special cases\n       *\n       * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`'s grammar\n       * will be ignored.\n       *\n       * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:\n       *\n       * ```js\n       * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', {\n       *     'comment': Prism.languages.markup.comment,\n       *     // tokens after 'comment'\n       * });\n       * ```\n       *\n       * ## Limitations\n       *\n       * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object\n       * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave\n       * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can't be implemented by temporarily\n       * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.\n       *\n       * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn't actually insert the given tokens into the target object.\n       * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This\n       * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.\n       *\n       * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced. I.e. if\n       * you hold the target object in a variable, then the value of the variable will not change.\n       *\n       * ```js\n       * var oldMarkup = Prism.languages.markup;\n       * var newMarkup = Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', { ... });\n       *\n       * assert(oldMarkup !== Prism.languages.markup);\n       * assert(newMarkup === Prism.languages.markup);\n       * ```\n       *\n       * @param {string} inside The property of `root` (e.g. a language id in `Prism.languages`) that contains the\n       * object to be modified.\n       * @param {string} before The key to insert before.\n       * @param {Grammar} insert An object containing the key-value pairs to be inserted.\n       * @param {Object<string, any>} [root] The object containing `inside`, i.e. the object that contains the\n       * object to be modified.\n       *\n       * Defaults to `Prism.languages`.\n       * @returns {Grammar} The new grammar object.\n       * @public\n       */\n      insertBefore: function insertBefore(inside, before, insert, root) {\n        root = root ||\n        /** @type {any} */\n        _.languages;\n        var grammar = root[inside];\n        /** @type {Grammar} */\n\n        var ret = {};\n\n        for (var token in grammar) {\n          if (grammar.hasOwnProperty(token)) {\n            if (token == before) {\n              for (var newToken in insert) {\n                if (insert.hasOwnProperty(newToken)) {\n                  ret[newToken] = insert[newToken];\n                }\n              }\n            } // Do not insert token which also occur in insert.
